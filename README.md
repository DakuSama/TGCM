# TGCM
Group Student Project Unity
This project was one of my second-year exams. We were tasked with creating a 2D game prototype as a group by integrating features from three independent games to hybridize them into a new game concept.
The three games chosen were Fire Emblem, Guitar Hero, and For the King.

During this project, there were two programmers. The first focused on coding the combat phases, while I worked on the movement phase (movement grid, AI, pathfinding, and turn management). The sprites and VFX were created by other group members, and the music used was royalty-free.
